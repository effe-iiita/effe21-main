<h3>Weird Work Works</h3>



<p>I could show you a phenomenal piece of advertising that is saving the world and cleaning up at award ceremonies. But I won’t. I wanted to take this chance to talk about what I want to see more of in advertising. The undeniable fact that weird work works. And by weird work I mean the uncanny, the strange, the bizarre. The mix of random, catchy, and odd that makes weird advertising memorable. </p>



<p>But why does it work? Well, the short answer is, we don’t fully know. Weird ads demand your attention and stay&nbsp;with you.&nbsp;And that’s exactly what great advertising should do.&nbsp;From a gorilla&nbsp;playing the drums to a Japanese commercial that features a mouth eating a snack from the back of a person’s neck. It doesn&#8217;t make sense, but it just works.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>I think right now we are at a turning point in advertising. The heaviness of being locked in our homes and living life on repeat has made us yearn for something new. Something odd and far away from the everyday. People want to be entertained and it’s our chance to win people&nbsp;over. For people to (dare&nbsp;I say) actually like advertising again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;great example of the weird renaissance on the way is&nbsp;the piece I have chosen to discuss.&nbsp;Starburst’s 2007 commercial “Bus Station” better known as “Little Lad&#8221; created by TBWA\Chiat\Day New York.&nbsp;It&#8217;s beautifully random and odd but underneath it drives the key product message -highlighting a new flavour. It was a risk and&nbsp;could have been a very different ad but everything worked out perfectly. The right director, (Randy Krallman)&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;casting, wardrobe, writing and a very trusting&nbsp;client.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p><br>Although a successful ad at the time it has had a resurgence and became relevant again after 14 years. In the&nbsp;past few months the character’s repetitive song and weird dance have been viewed more than 350 million times on TikTok. The ad has been remixed, danced to, haunted dreams and even inspired its own genre of fan fiction.&nbsp;So what is the magic that revived an ad 14 years&nbsp;later, on one of world’s most popular platforms? Weirdness.&nbsp;No outrageous gags. It’s just really and universally weird. Plain and simple.&nbsp;Those weird ads bury themselves in your mind. And there’s a new generation that love to see it.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>The #1 Strategy of High-Performance Brands</strong></h4>
<p><em>For this month&#8217;s Book Club, Charlotte Bourke gives us her take on &#8220;Zag: The #1 Strategy of High-Performance Brands&#8221; by Marty Neumeier.<br /></em></p>
<p>Marty Neumeier has written several excellent books on brands and branding. His most influential being The Brand Gap and ZAG.</p>
<p>ZAG maintains The Brand Gap’s ultra-clear narrative style but delves deeper into the question of how brands can harness the power of differentiation to stand out. The purpose of this book is to help brands in developing a value proposition that is distinct from competitors&#8217; offerings. Neumeier contends that in today&#8217;s extremely crowded marketplace, traditional differentiation is no longer sufficient; instead, companies must engage in &#8220;<em>radical differentiation</em>&#8221; to create long-term value for their shareholders and customers. The new rule? When everyone else zigs, you must ZAG.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>If you search for the term &#8220;branding&#8221; on Google, you will find 6,999,000,000 results in less than a second. It’s something everyone knows and talks about, but only a small handful have built a successful brand and can explain how they did it. Neumeier has and can. He delivers just the right amount of information and clear direction by using clever examples that help define the process of successful branding. The book does well in breaking down this process into easy-to-follow steps, helpfully devoid of any business jargon, instead focusing on being logical and effective.</p>
<p>The core concept within these some 200 pages really focuses on the importance of finding, building, and maintaining one’s ZAG; the differentiating factor, which when viewed by consumers, works to define a brand. In effect, it requires looking at what your competition is doing, then doing something different in response – <em>really</em> different. But so many brands today simply follow the market, which results in them getting lost amongst the clutter of an extremely crowded marketplace. In fact, oftentimes, the enemy isn’t a competing company but is in fact the old way of doing things (zigging along with your competitors).</p>
<p>If you think about it, the average person is estimated to be exposed to anything from 6,000 to 10,000 ads every single day – that’s a lot to be thrown anyone’s way, so you might forgive someone for not being able to remember every single piece of comms they ‘see’ (<em>especially when so many are all trying to do the same thing</em>). People may be getting exposed to thousands of ads every day, but they aren’t really <em>seeing</em> very many of them. In short, without any sort of radical differentiation, even the most successful of brands can run the risk of getting lost in the abyss of beige-ness.</p>
<p>By breaking down <em>ZAG</em> into 3 core factors, Neumeier gives his readers an easy-to-understand guide to effectively standing out against the competition:</p>
<p><strong>1. Finding your Zag:<br /></strong>This part is self-explanatory; to find your zag, you first need to go where your competition isn’t (differentiation); find the dynamics between different and good; look for the white space and find ways to parade it (finding a trend) – these core areas serve as the keys to finding your zag.</p>
<p><strong>2. Designing (and building) your Zag:<br /></strong>In this section, Neumeier shares his “17 checkpoints” system designed to invoke both reflective &amp; pragmatic thought by asking key questions at each stage; starting out with “<em>who are you</em>” and “<em>what do you do</em>” and finishing with “<em>how do you extend your success</em>” and “<em>how do you protect your portfolio</em>”. </p>
<p><strong>3. Renewing your Zag: <br /></strong>While the bulk of this book focuses on helping readers in finding and designing their zag, the final (albeit smaller) section provides a plethora of valuable resources for those who may need a zag renewal – those more established brands/businesses who may have potentially lost some of their focus along the way. Key insights are provided to help businesses to find both their uniqueness and their vision once again.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is well written, concise and to the point; filled with nuggets of wisdom that are as effective as they are logical. While it isn’t necessarily a heavily padded read (I flew through it in a few short sessions), it’s an ideal size to keep, a book you can refer to time and time again for snippets of advice and inspiration on how to do different.</p>
<p>To quote Neumeier, “<em>brand history abounds with evidence that David can take on Goliath and win – the goal is not to topple the big guys, but to employ the principle of contrast to throw your zag into sharp relief</em>”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<p>I would encourage anyone who may be interested in starting their own business, who is in any sort of business leadership position (both within and outside of marketing and communications departments) or whose curiosity is piqued by doing and thinking differently to pick themselves up a copy of this today.</p>
<h2>★★★★★ (out of 5)</h2>

<p><em>by Margaret Gilsenan, <span>Chief Strategy Officer</span><br /></em></p>
<p>For anyone who has entered industry awards, you will know they are hard work.  The AIMs, D&amp;ADs, ICADs, Sharks, Effies, Cannes, all involve various levels of selecting work, poring over data, writing papers, creating case films.  And when you have an entry date looming, you ask yourself the question… is this worth it?  Would life not be easier without constant competition?</p>
<p>There is also a creeping prevailing sense in society that competition is bad, it brings out the worst in us.  It creates inequality.  It should be confined to the sports field.</p>
<p>Having asked my competitive self ‘is this worth it’ mid Effies, I decided to study what advantage competition brings with it, for us as individuals and as businesses.  My conclusion is that I agree with  Tim Cook who said &#8220;<em>The reality is, is that we love competition….. we think it makes us all better”</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly the writings also suggest that there is as much advantage to competing with yourself as there is with others. Setting your own goals, beating your own previously held records.</p>
<p>Here are ten benefits (there are probably more) outlining the common themes across all my reading that healthy competition* brings with it… in life, in sport, in business.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It keeps us on our toes</strong>. Having a competitive nature prevents complacency.  If you succeed, you are motivated to always improve.  If you fail, you can use it to motivate yourself to keep going. </li>
<li><strong>It generates more clarity</strong>. You can’t be competitive at something unless you know what you are aiming for.</li>
<li><strong>It inspires greater creativity</strong>. To do things better, you need to be a better problem solver and be more solution driven.</li>
<li><strong>It causes you to do more self-reflection</strong>. To do better, you will need to know your strengths and weaknesses, and identify what you need to improve.</li>
<li><strong>It compels us to give things a go</strong>. Because competitive people tend to see failure as part of the journey not the end of it. They are more comfortable failing, in the hope that next time will be better/successful.</li>
<li><strong>It is satisfying</strong>. When managed properly, and realistically, it brings the satisfaction of completing goals.</li>
<li><strong>It motivates us to strive to do better.</strong> <em>&#8220;Believing that your competition is stronger and better than you pushes you to better yourselves.&#8221;</em> Simon Sinek.</li>
<li><strong>It makes us resilient.</strong> Competitive people don’t always win, they have to have wider comfort zones.  You learn to cope with failing, to dust yourself down, and get back on that horse.</li>
<li><strong>It makes us makes us hopeful.</strong> You look to the competition, and ask if they can do it so can I?  You focus on the good, and ignore the bad. </li>
<li><strong>It helps us to live fuller lives</strong>, because you live with the belief that anything is possible. Michael Jordan: <em>&#8220;You have competition every day because you set such high standards for yourself that you have to go out every day and live up to that.&#8221;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Off now to compete against myself,  Je pars pour établir un nouveau record personnel en Duolingo.</p>
<p><em>* Disclaimer: Love this picture of the Bonny Baby competition in Butlins but do not consider it ‘Healthy Competition’.</em></p>

<p><em>by Aoife Murphy, Executive Strategy Director</em></p>



<p>Ever bought something, worn it, and returned it anyway? If you answered yes, apparently lots of other people do too, and it costs the fashion industry $15billion a year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="686" height="484" src="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2262" srcset="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel.png 686w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-600x423.png 600w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></figure>



<p>Instead of blacklisting serial returners or making a stricter returns policy, Italian fashion giant, Diesel, encouraged the practice.</p>



<p>Their ‘Enjoy Before Returning’ campaign for the autumn/winter line asked people to wear their clothes with the label out and return them to the store &#8211; no questions asked.</p>



<p>The launch featured a fashion show where all the models’ clothes had the labels on display and Diesel turned the exact words of their returns policy into a music video.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Enjoy Before Returning - DIESEL FW19" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtAuHfBYwJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The unexpected angle and edgy, 90s punk style execution gives the brand a sense of quiet rebellion while also showcasing the clothes beautifully.</p>



<h4>Why we like it</h4>



<p>Fashion is getting a bad rap at the minute on the sustainability front. Without preaching about their environmental strategy, Diesel actively leans into the circular economy movement. And they’re doing it with an attitude that makes Diesel look and feel distinct in what can sometimes be a same-y category.</p>



<p>Brand experiential should give you a clear sense of the brand and let you experience the product. This does both incredibly well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="776" height="548" src="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2261" srcset="https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2.png 776w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-768x542.png 768w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-600x424.png 600w, https://boysandgirls.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Diesel-2-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /></figure>



<h4><strong>What can we learn from it?</strong></h4>



<p>Oftentimes, marketers are asked to move consumers from one behaviour to another. Accentuating or leveraging existing behaviour is often overlooked when it could be the path of least resistance.</p>



<p>Here, the confident approach of bringing a closed behaviour out into the open, ended up leading to reduced online and in-store return rate.</p>



<p>What early behaviours or trends are you seeing around your product or brand that you could lean into?</p>

<h4>40 Ways To Stack The Odds In Your Brand&#8217;s Favour</h4>
<p><em>Patrick Meade, Chief Executive Officer at Boys+Girls, is here this month with his take on “Go Luck Yourself&#8221; by Andy Nairn<br /></em></p>
<p>Luck is a four-letter-word in business circles. But the truth is that fortune plays a part in every success story – and every failure. In this book, Andy Nairn discusses 40 ways to stack the odds in your brand’s favour.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>Undeterred by the puntastic title, I was really looking forward to this book. Andy is a founder and chief strategist for Lucky Generals &#8211; one of the most successful UK start-ups in recent years, with a long list of award-winning creative effectiveness campaigns for local and international brands like Hovis and Amazon Prime.<br /><br />In reality, this is less of a book and more a collection of case studies akin to the familiar style of Dave Trott’s collection of columns for Campaign that he has formed into successful books in recent years. The way the book is constructed makes this effort more useful in my opinion. While there is always a great lesson in each of Dave’s yarns, Andy gives the reader more digestible strategic advice in each chapter. There are good local and international examples to back up each piece of advice, and he extends these beyond case studies from his own career and agency. Which is good because otherwise it might read more like a CV.<br /><br />The title itself is tongue in cheek. None of the examples are what you could truly describe as luck, like finding a twenty euro note on the pavement. They are really examples of broad thinking that may appear as luck to the untrained eye, but in truth are very deliberate acts. I agree with Andy that luck, and indeed its sibling ‘gut instinct’, are mistreated in commercial circles. Both are misnomers. Often used inaccurately to describe what is usually the result of a relentlessly curious mind.<br /><br />This book won’t make you luckier. You won’t bounce from one Effectiveness Gold to the next just by reading it. However, it will make you a better strategic thinker. Which is unsurprising as it comes from one of the brightest planning minds of his generation.<br /><br />Because Andy is well known in agency land, I think this book is more likely to be read by agency people, but I think everyone in a marketing role could read and learn from it. Many of the lessons in it apply to ‘conventional thinking’ in client organisations that end up being challenged by more free thinking (and risk tasking) agency strategists. If that conventional thinking can be challenged before the agency is briefed, it would multiply the success rate and make the challenge of selling unconventional ideas easier to stakeholders.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<p>In summary, I’d advise you to read the book, be entertained by the stories, then copy and paste each of the 40 questions that end every chapter into a document. The next time you’re facing a tricky brand situation or a challenging brief, try posing these questions to the problem, one-by-one, until it sparks something. You never know. You might get lucky and find the answer staring you in the face.</p>
<h2>★★★★ (out of 5)</h2>

<p><em>by Karleen Smyth, <span>Senior Experiential Director</span><br /></em></p>
<p>Our world was upended in 2020. Amid the global chaos, brands who had spent many months and euros curating their experiential marketing plans had to pull the plug, at the time not knowing if it was the right thing to do. Anything that involved physical customer engagement was deemed unsafe. It’s the type of situation that will form the basis of case studies in years to come.</p>
<p>18+ months later, and despite mass vaccine roll-out, we are still living surrounded by a level of uncertainty. Many industry professionals were certain September 2021 would mark the point where some form of normality would resume. Yet, we are still waiting for that assurance.</p>
<p>From an industry perspective, it’s easy to focus on the negatives, the missed opportunities, missed experiences. When we speak about experiential marketing, the conversation focuses on the lack of live events. Yes, it’s true, we’ve missed out on some great live experiences, the big and the small. Who would have thought that the legendary Glastonbury Festival wouldn’t celebrate their 50th birthday. However we need to recognise that there have been some positives to come from all of this. Experiential marketing is a big part of how brands stay relevant and connected with, and as an industry we have been forced to think differently and more creatively about how to use experiential marketing in the face of a Pandemic and Post Pandemic world.</p>
<p>With physical experiences no longer an option, the industry searched for alternatives and undertook an impressive digital transformation. Tomorrowland Festival is a great example of this. The team behind the Belgian music festival pushed the boundaries of the latest technology available and created a revolutionary interactive virtual world. And whilst this was the ultimate online music experience with truly impressive production values, the conclusion was that there is nothing quite like the engagement of an in-person experience.</p>
<p>So, how do we adapt to a world where live is not always going to be possible for everyone? How do we take the positives of our lockdown experiences and invent an experiential world that is even better for our brands? One that ensures maximum leverage of what social epidemiologists are predicting as a post-pandemic ‘roaring 20’s’, where people are expected to seek out all-embracing social interactions, just as they did after the 1918 flu pandemic?</p>
<p>How do we get match-fit for a new experiential world with new behaviours, new rules and new technologies?</p>
<p>We have seen AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality) and even XR (Extended Reality), form the basis for many concepts. But future-facing brands are already moving onto the next era. We are now exploring a shift in the way consumers and brands interact, and looking at how we as an industry create and utilise a strong hybrid brand identity, the metaverse. Yes, it’s a term used in a 1992 sci-fi film, but it’s<strong> </strong>also set to be a new chapter of the experience economy. A network of always-on virtual environments in which multiple people, operating avatars of themselves, can interact with digital objects and engage with one another. Netflix were quick to move into this space and have just launched a gamified version of the iconic <em>Stranger Things</em> Starcourt Mall on metaverse platform Roblox, whilst other brands are experimenting with the platform by leveraging existing virtual platforms. It’s the next level for brands to create a two-way interactive and dynamic relationship with their consumers.</p>
<p>Though this may be a step too far, too soon for many, it is important to keep a watchful eye on this space. Because, 2020/21 has shown that it’s time to embrace a different type of experiential thinking and to put it at the heart of brand building. Brands need to keep an open-mind and explore new routes to engage with their audience. Progression is vital. No matter what the format, it is possible to ensure your brand produces an effective and engaging experience, provided you’re working with good data, clear objectives and a strong baseline strategy.</p>
<p>This new world involves engaging people differently and making sure your audience knows you’re listening. We now know the possibilities are endless, we just have to embrace them!</p>

<p><em>by Pat Stephenson, Chief Relationship Officer</em></p>



<p>Great work makes everything better. Better results, more satisfaction, better commercials. Everything. We’ve believed that for a <em>looong</em> time now. But it’s still rejuvenating when you get a large jolt of great work mainlined into your system. Which is exactly what’s happened to me over the weeks and months since we joined By The Network – an international network of the world’s leading independent agencies.<br> <br>Getting to know our amazing co-members has been &#8211; and is &#8211;  exhilarating. Literally every agency is top of their game  &#8211; sectorally or geographically – with best in class agencies all over the world from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mrpositive.work/" target="_blank">MrPositive</a> in Tokyo to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://girlsareawesome.com/" target="_blank">Girls Are Awesome</a>.<br> <br>So for Stuff We Like I wanted to pull out three of the best pieces I’ve seen from some of our new agency friends.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><br /><span><strong>The Hiring Chain </strong></span><em><span>by Small</span></em><br /><br /><span>This is a really simple idea, brilliantly executed about the circular, multiplier effect of hiring someone with Down Syndrome &#8211; brought to life with a great song, sung by Sting. What’s not to like?</span><span><br /><br />This has absolutely beasted the award shows, and rightly so, picking up Silver and Bronze at Cannes, Graphite and Wood &amp; D&amp;AD and 2 Gold and a Silver at New York Festival. Small are such an incredible agency – their work for Diesel is absolutely top notch.</span></p>



<p></p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>2030 Calculator&nbsp;</strong><em>by The Farm</em></p>



<p>Climate Change can feel like an impossible thing to try and tackle. At this stage most people realise there is a significant problem but other than some basic behaviours it can feel almost impossible to try and make meaningful changes.<br><br>This idea from the awesome people at <a href="https://www.farmagency.se/">The Farm</a> in Stockholm is a brilliantly simple prompt – A Carbon Calculator that allows any business to showcase the potential Carbon footprint of everything you buy – so as a consumer you are aware and can make better choices.</p>



<p>An idea build with utility and ease in mind, again this swept the floor at the awards shows winning a Grand Prix at Cannes, a D&amp;AD Yellow Pencil and a Grand Prix at Eurobest.</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><span><strong>White Towels&nbsp;</strong></span><em><span>by Mortier Brigade</span></em><br><br><span>Lastly this is a devastatingly simple idea from <a href="https://mortierbrigade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://mortierbrigade.com/">Mortier Brigade</a> in Belgium that attempts to bring to life the real horror of the situation facing many refugees trying to get into Europe.&nbsp; It tackles the problem of these issues feeling so removed from our day to day – and manages to make them feel all too real.</span><span><br><br>Like the best ideas its simplicity is its strength&#8230;<br></span></p>
<p><span><br>I’ve barely scratched the surface of the surface when it comes to the amazing work and agencies within By The Network but if like me you take energy and stimulation from seeing great work feel free to check out <a href="https://bythenetwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://bythenetwork.com/">https://bythenetwork.com/</a> and get mainlining.</span></p>

<h3><strong>How Anthropology Can Explain Business &amp; Life. <br /></strong></h3>
<p><em>This month Marget Gilsenan, Chief Strategy Officer gives us her opinions on “How Anthropology Can Explain Business &amp; Life&#8221; by Gillian Tett.</em></p>
<p>In Anthro-Vision Gillian Tett reveals how anthropology can make sense of the corporate world.  That it is not just a tool to study tribes and cultures in far flung places, but rather a powerful way to understand human behaviour, identify webs of meaning and complement and enhance how we understand the world and the larger cultural context of our business decisions.</p>
<p>Using diverse examples from pre-school selection, Cambridge Analytica, the 2008 crash, Trump, working from home, petfood, soup, laundry habits, sustainability – Tett shows how anthropology can be used to help us observe the tribes and rituals and exist all around us “hidden in plain sight” and help us make better decisions in our business and personal lives.</p>
<h4>What did I think</h4>
<p>This book champions two fundamental truths that I subscribe to in business. One, that as quoted from Meg Kinney, <em>“Every business problem is a human problem, and every data point represents some human behaviour at its core”</em>; and two, to provide truly creative solutions to those problems, each of us will be better and more open to new thinking if we are compulsively curious.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections, each peppered with examples and insights from Tett’s own experiences, huge social issues and the corporate world.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Making the “Strange” Familiar</strong>. It challenges us to stop shying away from that which seems strange, but rather work with it.  To recognise that your worldview is not everyone’s. There is a nice example to do with in-car technology.  Car drivers had been asked direct questions about technology which they claimed to be using.  Engineers installed embedded voice command systems in cars to reduce distracted driving.  They were starting with their own world view of it. But subsequently when observed, drivers were using the technology but not through the in-built in-car tech, they were actually using their personal handheld devices.  So, the solution which we see in most cars nowadays is the ability to sync our own personal devices with our cars i.e. looking at the world through the user&#8217;s eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Making the ‘Familiar” Strange</strong>. As Anais Nin said <em>“what we are familiar with, we fail to see”</em>.  With Tett’s experience as The Financial Time’s, Editor At Large – there are numerous examples from the financial world and how that familiarity or normalising of certain behaviours, acronyms etc within the financial ‘tribe’ played a significant role in the 2008 crash.  She challenges us to think and study our own WEIRD world (Western, Educated, Individualistic, Rich and Democratic) to help understand (and stop missing) behaviours and triggers that shape our decisions, with examples including how after an anthropological study of food preparation, Campbell’s Soup successfully moved their marketing emphasis from convenience (the reported benefit) to creativity (the observed benefit) of their brand in its users lives.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Listen to Social Silence</strong> and see what is hidden in plain sight. To see beyond the words that are being spoken and create frames of analysis that help us make sense of all that is going on&#8230; examples here from Trump (and why his use of the word ‘Bigly’ should not have been dismissed) and Cambridge Analytica.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>It also helps us use Big Data more effectively, <em>“We have been forced to rethink some of the ways we use data, at the beginning there was a lot of excitement about Big Data and we still firmly believe that getting better statistics is very important and technology can do amazing things.  But we cannot be naïve – understanding the social context matters”</em>, Melinda Gates.</p>
<p>This book provokes each of us to ask the right questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Who should read it</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is not a marketing book; it is for anyone who recognises the importance and value of being compulsively curious. Across all disciplines.</li>
<li>Anyone who is working with Big Data as a deeper cultural understanding or open-mindedness will complement and give context to that Data making it more valuable.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>by Rory Hamilton, Chief Creative Officer<br /></em></p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to judge a number of advertising awards. If you’ve never done it, it’s an interesting process. You fly to somewhere sunny (think Dubai or Las Vegas)  and then spend a week frustratingly locked in a dark room with no windows alongside a dozen strangers, for 12 hours a day, to argue over some of the best work in the world. It&#8217;s tiring, occasionally confrontational (the jurors are opinionated people whose profession revolves around building convincing arguments) but it’s also genuinely life changing. Something about this pressurised environment coupled with the enforced exposure makes you friends with these people – you can build relationships that’ll last your whole career. All in all it’s a privilege, you can learn more in a week’s judging than you might in a year of work.  </p>
<p>Judging Cannes is arguably the high point of this judging circuit, so 2 years ago when I was invited to judge at Cannes Lions, boy was I excited. The prospect of a week surrounded by some of the most inspirational creatives in the world, all in the South of France was an enticing one. It would be fair to say that, during those 2 years, more important global events transpired (no need to fire up those tiny violins for me) so when the Cannes festival was postponed and eventually cancelled in 2020, it was inevitably replaced by a remote festival in 2021. I was still invited to judge, only this time from the “comfort” of my house.</p>
<p>Remote judging is a different animal entirely. For Cannes it involved a pre-judging section, for which you had approximately 40-50 hours of films to watch over a few weeks, followed by an “in person” Zoom judging, which took 5 hrs a day for 8 days. The jurors were selected from all over the world, making time zones a massive issue. We Europeans got lucky, so that my sessions were 2-7pm. Spare a thought for the jurors from LA or Buenos Aires whose sessions started as early as 5am, and for our friend from Tokyo, his day started at 10pm.</p>
<p>The thing about judging remotely is that it brings all of the argument, but little of the conciliatory coffee breaks or boozy dinners together in which you get to heal the wounds of battle. You never really get a handle on your fellow jurors, you never see where they’re coming from, save a small section of their bedroom wall or blurred office &#8211; their whole backstory told across a few feet of backdrop. And instead of real discourse, instead of real debate you sit muzzled, on-mute until it’s your turn to make a case for, or against a piece of work. I sat on my hands so long they developed “pins and needles”.</p>
<p>Worse still when you’re judging remotely you&#8217;re “available”. Somehow being in Cannes seems out of bounds, but when you’re “upstairs” – surely you can mind the baby, let the electrician in, settle your children’s sisterly dispute – after all you’re right there. Same goes for the office, little meetings get “popped in diaries”, “just a catch up, to keep you in the loop”. Try squeezing an extra 5 hour zoom call into your day – it’s not easy.</p>
<p>However by the end of the 8 days the work became second nature, no need to view an entry for the 400<sup>th</sup> time, I could recite the scripts as I judged them. Through that fog, with the pressure of an impending deadline, we found our rhythm. Somehow this band of strangers had become a group, even a team. We settled disputes, we supported opinions, we leaned on each other’s individual expertise (shouldn’t the professional grader have the casting vote when we are judging grade?) It only took 40 hours of zooming together but we became friends. Spending that amount of time, not just among the best work in the world, but surrounded by some of the best people was just as inspiring, just as much of an honour as it would have been from the South of France.</p>
<p>But at the end of it all, would I consider judging Cannes again from my house? Not remotely.</p>
<p>Postscript.</p>
<p>Not only did I judge Cannes for the first time, but we also won it. Yes you may have heard, I’ve been trying to casually shoehorn it into conversation for the last few weeks, a Gold and a Bronze. It&#8217;s incredible in its own right. But I do think that experiencing the process of judging makes the result even more gratifying. So to whatever jurors sat and argued for our work, from whatever bedroom or office around the world – thank you! I know it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>After a two year wait for Cannes International Festival of Creativity to return, we were absolutely delighted to be awarded our first Lions, even if we weren’t there in person to collect on stage! We won a Gold&nbsp;in the Consumer Services / Business to Business category in Creative Strategy Lions and a Bronze in Consumer Services/ Business to Business in the Brand Experience &amp; Activation Lions.</p>



<p>Both Lions were awarded&nbsp;for our long running Island campaign for Three Ireland featuring Arranmore Island off the coast of Donegal. Three used the island to demonstrate it’s B2B capabilities by treating it as an enterprise customer, bringing connectivity and building a digital hub which enabled multiple initiatives to thrive on the island, after years of economic decline. Our subsequent campaign delivered huge results for the brand, and the island, reversing years of population decline.</p>



<p>Cannes is globally recognised as the benchmark for commercial creativity and to see our Island campaign awarded amongst this international talent is incredible. To illustrate what we mean – the&nbsp;Creative Strategy Lions,&nbsp;which honour work that demonstrates how strategic planning can redefine a brand, received&nbsp;a total of 677 entries and awarded only 3 Golds.</p>



<p>We’re over the moon to win for a campaign which has delivered real, tangible results for real people &amp; the brand. Roll of Cannes 2022!</p>
